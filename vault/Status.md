# Project Status

Read this at the start of every session. Keep it short and current.

## Overview
**Train Runner** (working title) — Roblox experience, built Studio-first with Claude Code via the
Roblox Studio MCP server. See [[Game Design Document]] and [[Art Direction]].

## Current phase
Pre-production. **The gameplay design is settled.** The [[Game Design Document]] and all its
feature notes are `planned`:
- [[Wild West Enemies]],
- [[Launch Agents]],
- [[Gadgets and Mayhem]],
- [[Score and Combo]],
- [[Economy and Monetization]].

Three things are not settled yet:
- **naming**: the title, agency, hub train, agents and gang,
- **[[Art Direction]]**: now `planned`. The only open item is ShadowMap vs Future
  lighting, which waits for a mobile test. No reference images yet,
- **number tuning**, which needs playtests. The original's numbers are loose reference only.

**Next step: M0 Bootstrap in Studio**, which must be done from a local Claude Code
session with the Studio MCP connected.

## In progress
- _(nothing yet)_

## Next up
- Technical architecture is settled. ADRs 0004–0010 are all accepted.
- Review [[Writing and Dialogue]] (barks, tutorial, missions, challenge chains) and the
  open points in [[Loop (M2)]] (tie = continue, 90 s AFK safeguard).
- **Start building from [[First Playable (M1)]].** It lists sessions 1–6, from M0
  Bootstrap to the M1 playtest, in order.
- **M0 Bootstrap** in Studio: server/client bootstraps, Remotes, Constants and Types (see
  `CLAUDE.md` → architecture). This needs a local session; cloud sessions can't reach
  Studio.
- Figma UI mockups (linked in [[Art Direction]] §10). These are done: PC HUD, mobile
  HUD, run end, Party Lobby, Squad Select and Armory. The Figma Starter plan's
  tool-call limit was hit, so these are still to do:
  - swap both HUDs to the decided Mayhem ring (left edge, gadget fan; teammate rings
    glow when ready),
  - Boosters, Checkpoint (continue or cash out), Surplus Shop, Missions and daily
    challenge, Store and Exchange, Downed and Squad Wiped, and Leaderboards screens.
- Add reference images to `05 Assets/References/` (the list is in [[Art Direction]] §13)
  before modelling starts in M1.
- Name the agency, hub train, agents and gang ([[Title Ideas]]).
- Design leftovers:
  - Mimi's Invisible Bow charge formula ([[Launch Agents]]).
  - The exact knock-out ragdoll limits (GDD → Tone).
- Tune in playtests:
  - enemy damage ([[Wild West Enemies]]),
  - Mayhem fill rates and mech armour ([[Gadgets and Mayhem]]),
  - score values and the combo window ([[Score and Combo]]),
  - prices and earn rates ([[Economy and Monetization]]).

## Known issues / open problems
- _(none yet)_

## Unsaved work in Studio
- _(note here if the place has changes that still need saving/publishing)_
